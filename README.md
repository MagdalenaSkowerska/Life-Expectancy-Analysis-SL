# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms for Life Expectancy Analysis

The aim of the project is to **forecast** the **life expectancy** by considering different factors
such as: air pollution, diet, GDP per capita, lifestyle, education etc. and analyze common
characteristics between different groups of countries identified.
The dataset used for this purpose is retrieved from the online community Kaggle, The Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Our World in Data.

The **first part** describes the dataset used in the analysis and some checks are performed to
ensure its **quality and suitability for applying the models**. An evaluation of the different
methods to select the most important predictors has been done to address the
**multicollinearity** issue and to assess their impact on the improvement of the models
performance.

In the **second part**, different predictive models are compared by using the following
Supervised Learning techniques: **Decision Trees, Random Forest** and **Boosting**. A
comparison between the **Root Mean Square Error** of all the models has been made to
highlight which has the best performance.

The **third part**, analyzes the data by using Unsupervised Learning techniques such as: **K-
Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**. Through the analysis, it is possible to identify countries
with similar characteristics where some interventions are needed to improve the quality of
life, and so to increase the life expectancy considering the most influential factors.
